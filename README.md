# How The Game Works
"The Doge" is a planet in the center of game. The dogecoin of "The Doge" is displayed in the game. "The Doge" is like a cash pool for players to loot. The spaceship of the player is created near their home planet. The home planets of players are created with a distance to "The Doge" planet according to normal distribution. The players need to control their spaceships to loot dogecoin from other planets. When a player loots a planet, the planet will emit a death wave, which is deadly towards any ships. The spaceships controled by the players can also emit death wave but with shorter radius. When a spaceship with dogecoin payload gets destroyed by a death wave, the dogecoin will be automatically transferred to the spaceship/planet that kills the spaceship. Regarding the landing, the spaceship can only successfully land by landing vertically with its head up and velocity below crash threshold.
